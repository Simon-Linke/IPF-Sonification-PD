## Demo Sounds

This folder dontains demo sounds produced with the script *"2_excitation_beta.pd"* for all combinations of three different $\alpha$ (0.379, 0.511, and 0.573) and three different $\beta$ (0, 0.24, and 0.5). Each file name consists of four numbers, where the first two refer to the incoming midi parameters, while the latter two refer to the resulting modeling parameters of the IPF: The first number always begins with *nn* and describes the pressed midi note number, the second one beginning with *vl* shows the related velocity, the third number beginning with *a* names the related $\alpha$ (where a decimal point should be imagined after the first zero) and the last number beginning with *b* refers to $\beta$ (again with an imaginary decimal point after the first zero).
